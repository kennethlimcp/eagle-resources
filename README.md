#### Improvements made

Here are some modifications that i made after encountering much ///friction\\\ working on my own PCB design.

- Standardized font for common parts like SMD resistor
- Using 40mil, 20%, Vector font which proves to be clearly visible using the fab house i'm familiar with
- Standardized naming/part - This will make the BOM generation easily and less confusing by having the specification for the parts under **values**
